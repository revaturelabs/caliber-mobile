# caliber-mobile

# Introduction:
    This projects constitutes the cumulative work of the React Native Cloud branch. It is a mobile version of the Caliber application

The goal of this application is to allow Trainers, the QC Team and Managers to view and modify QC data on a batch for a given week and recieve feedback in the form of technical status updates and charts to best judge a batches progress.
