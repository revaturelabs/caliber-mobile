# caliber-mobile

# Introduction:
    This projects constitutes the cumulative work of the React Native Cloud branch. It is a mobile version of the Caliber application

The app will closely resemble the web version which was previously created by the internal dev-team at Revature but will be styled and tailored instead to a mobile environment, including both Web and Android builds for phone usage.
